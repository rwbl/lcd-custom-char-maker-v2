# lcd-custom-char-maker-v2
Create Custom Characters for LCD displays connected to Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Tinkerforge or other.

## Functionality
* Create custom LCD character with 5 pixel horizontal (cols), 8 pixel vertical (rows).
* Each row is represented by a byte with 5 bits.
* Create DEC, HEX and BIN arrays.
* Save / open the character to / from a textfile located in the application folder.
* Import 8 bytes array string in format 0xNN,0xNN... where NN is HEX value.
* Convert LCD character table high & low bits to DEC & HEX values.
* Various language specific examples
* Some example chars in the project source/objects folder.
**Developed for personal use only under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3.**

## Development
* Application developed with [Lazarus](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/) v2.0.12, [Free Pascal Compiler](https://www.freepascal.org/) 3.2.0.
* Source included and well documented.
* Application executable not included. Use Lazarus to build.
* Developed and tested under both Windows 10 and Ubuntu 20.04.

## Install
Unpack the ZIP archive to a folder of choice.
Load the Lazarus project file **lcdccm.lpi** in the Lazarus IDE and build.

## Example Pixel Arrays Custom Character Battery
For a character 5x8, the 8 entries of the array are holding 5 bits for each row.
```
DEC: 14,27,17,17,17,17,17,31
HEX: 0x0E,0x1B,0x11,0x11,0x11,0x11,0x11,0x1F
BIN: 0b01110,0b11011,0b10001,0b10001,0b10001,0b10001,0b10001,0b11111
```

### Python Tinkerforge
The LCD 20x4 Bricklet supports up to 8 custom characters 0-7 which are mapped to \u0008-\u000F (\u takes hex numbers).
Tested defining and writing custom characters with an LCD 20x4 v1.2 Bricklet having UID=BHN.
```

# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

#Tinkerforge LCD Custom Char example  Python
#Tested with Master Brick 2.1, LCD 20x4 Bricklet 1.2
#IMPORTANT=Change #UID# to the UID of the LCD 20x4 Bricklet

HOST = "localhost"
PORT = 4223
UID = "#UID#"

from tinkerforge.ip_connection import IPConnection
from tinkerforge.bricklet_lcd_20x4 import BrickletLCD20x4

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create IP connection
    ipcon = IPConnection()
    # Create device object
    lcd = BrickletLCD20x4(UID, ipcon)
    # Connect to brickd
    ipcon.connect(HOST, PORT)
    # Turn backlight on
    lcd.backlight_on()
    # Clear screen
    lcd.clear_display()
    # Write text at pos row=0,col=0
    lcd.write_line(0, 0, "Hello World")
    # Define custom character
    battery = [14,27,17,17,17,17,17,31]
    # Set the custom char at index 0 (from max 7)
    lcd.set_custom_character(0, battery)
    # Write custom char at pos row=1,col=0
    lcd.write_line(1,0,"\u0008")

```

### Hint
To write a character from the character table of the LCD Display driver.
The Degree Character Â° is located at position upper 4 bits 1101 and lower 4 bits 1111.
The 8 bits 1101 1111 are HEX DF and DEC 223.
To write the character to the LCD use lcd.Write(Array As Byte(223)).

### LCD Character Table
Convert Upper 4 & Lower 4 bits to HEX and Unicode
Example Cent Character: Upper 4 bits = 1110, Lower 4 bits = 1111
Converted:
11101111 = EF , 0xEF , \u00EF, 239
Use the LCD display datasheet accordingly.
